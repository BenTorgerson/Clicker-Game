# Clicker-Game

This is a game inspired by clicker games and strategy games. The goal is to build up your Kingdom by gathering resources. You can then build a military and attempt to take over more land.

The game is written entirely in Java, using JavaFX for the GUI.

Future additions will include more buildings, upgrades, an improved combat system, and achievements
